The advent of a panoply of resource limited devices opens up new challenges in the design of computer vision algorithms with a clear compromise between accuracy and computational requirements. In this paper we address this and introduce binary image descriptors that establish new operating points in the state-of-the-art's accuracy vs. resources trade-off curve.
We revisit descriptors based on pixel differences and gradients to introduce respectively BAD (Box Average Difference), the fastest binary descriptor in the literature, and HashSIFT.
They are trained using triplet ranking loss, hard negative mining and anchor swap, combined with a new efficient feature selection algorithm.
In our experiments we evaluate the accuracy, execution time and energy consumption of the proposed descriptors. We show that they are the most accurate when confronted with competing techniques with similar computational requirements. Further, in a planar image registration, HashSIFT  performs  on  par  with  the  top deep learning-based descriptors, being several orders of magnitude more efficient.
